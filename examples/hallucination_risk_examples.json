    "answer": "Photosynthesis is a complex biochemical process where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. This process was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz in 1779 and involves multiple stages including light-dependent and light-independent reactions. The efficiency of photosynthesis varies between plant species, with C4 plants being more efficient than C3 plants. The process produces oxygen as a byproduct and is responsible for removing approximately 100 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually.",
